Let’s review simple example of Pi4J how easy it is.

Firstly we need maven dependency:


```java
        //Let’s review simple example of Pi4J how easy it is.

        //Firstly we need maven dependency:

        <properties>
        <!-- DEPENDENCIES VERSIONS -->

        <version>${slf4j.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        
        <!-- include Pi4J Core -->

        <groupId>com.pi4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>pi4j-core</artifactId>
        <version>${pi4j.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        
        <!-- include Pi4J Plugins (Platforms and I/O Providers) -->
        <dependency>

        <artifactId>pi4j-plugin-gpiod</artifactId>
        <version>${pi4j.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        </dependencies>
        
        //Firstly we need to initialize a new runtime context:

        var pi4j = Pi4J.newAutoContext();
        //For example we can print some important information:

        Platforms platforms = pi4j.platforms();

        console.box("Pi4J PLATFORMS");
        console.println();
        platforms.describe().print(System.out);
        console.println();
        Let’s blink a LED example:

private static final int PIN_LED = 22;

        var led = pi4j.digitalOutput().create(PIN_LED);

        while (pressCount < 5) {
        if (led.state() == DigitalState.HIGH) {
        led.low();
        } else {
        led.high();
        }
        Thread.sleep(500 / (pressCount + 1));
        }
        //Here button press example:

private static int pressButtonCounter = 0;
private static final int PIN_BUTTON = 24;
        var buttonConfig = DigitalInput.newConfigBuilder(pi4j)
        .id("button")
        .name("Press button")
        .address(PIN_BUTTON)
        .pull(PullResistance.PULL_DOWN)
        .debounce(1000L);

        var button = pi4j.create(buttonConfig);

        button.addListener(e -> {
        if (e.state() == DigitalState.LOW) {
        pressButtonCounter++;
        console.println("Button was pressed " + pressButtonCounter+ " times");
        }
        });
        //Exit. To correctly free all resources we need to do shutdown:

        pi4j.shutdown();
        //To run this app on your RasperyPi you need do following. You need attach a LED, and recent Raspbian OS image with Java 11 or newer

        //Build project:

        mvn clean package
        // And after this you will have simple file run.sh inside build folder. And after that you have console output like this:

        LED high
        LED low
        LED high
        Button was pressed 1 times
```

To more detail examples you can use Pi4J Project Documentation.

This was a simple example. But Pi4J is particularly interesting for Java developers working on Raspberry Pi projects. Here are some reasons why Pi4J is worth using:

- GPIO Control: Pi4J provides an easy-to-use API for controlling the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins of the Raspberry Pi. This allows developers to interact with external sensors, LEDs, motors, and other electronic components connected to the GPIO pins.

Overall, Pi4J is a powerful and versatile library that enables Java developers to harness the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi for building a wide range of IoT, robotics, automation, and educational projects. Whether you’re a hobbyist, student, or professional developer, Pi4J offers a rich set of features for exploring the potential of Raspberry Pi hardware with Java.

Let’s create another example using Pi4J to control a servo motor connected to a Raspberry Pi. We’ll write a program that allows us to control the position of the servo motor using a potentiometer connected to an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Here’s the code:

```` java

import com.pi4j.io.gpio.Pin;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.RaspiPin;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.GpioFactory;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.GpioPinAnalogInput;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.GpioPinPwmOutput;

public class ServoControl {

    private static final Pin POTENTIOMETER_PIN = RaspiPin.GPIO_00;
    private static final Pin SERVO_PIN = RaspiPin.GPIO_01;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Create GPIO controller instance
        final com.pi4j.io.gpio.GpioController gpio = GpioFactory.getInstance();

        // Create analog input pin for the potentiometer
        final GpioPinAnalogInput potentiometer = gpio.provisionAnalogInputPin(POTENTIOMETER_PIN);

        // Create PWM output pin for the servo
        final GpioPinPwmOutput servoPin = gpio.provisionPwmOutputPin(SERVO_PIN);

        // Set the PWM range (1000-2000) for the servo
        servoPin.setPwmRange(1000);

        while (true) {
            // Read the potentiometer value (0-1023)
            int potValue = potentiometer.getValue();

            // Map potentiometer value to servo PWM range (1000-2000)
            int pwmValue = (int) map(potValue, 0, 1023, 1000, 2000);

            // Set the servo position
            servoPin.setPwm(pwmValue);

            // Wait for a short time
            Thread.sleep(20);
        }
    }

    // Helper function to map a value from one range to another
    private static double map(int x, int in_min, int in_max, int out_min, int out_max) {
        return (double) (x - in_min) * (out_max - out_min) / (in_max - in_min) + out_min;
    }
}
````
In this example:
- We import necessary Pi4J classes for controlling GPIO pins.
- We define the GPIO pins for connecting the potentiometer (analog input) and servo motor (PWM output).
- We create a main method where we initialize the GPIO controller and provision the GPIO pins.
- Inside the main loop, we continuously read the value of the potentiometer (0–1023) and map it to the PWM range of the servo motor (1000–2000). We then set the PWM output to control the position of the servo motor accordingly.

To run this example, make sure you have Pi4J installed on your Raspberry Pi, a servo motor connected to a GPIO pin, and a potentiometer connected to another GPIO pin (via an ADC if needed). Then compile and run the Java code on your Raspberry Pi. You should be able to control the position of the servo motor by rotating the potentiometer.

In conclusion, Pi4J offers Java developers a versatile and accessible way to interact with the GPIO pins of Raspberry Pi, enabling the creation of a wide range of IoT projects. With Pi4J, developers can easily integrate sensors, actuators, displays, and other peripherals into their Java applications, opening up endless possibilities for innovation in the IoT space.

Whether you’re a hobbyist, educator, or professional developer, Pi4J provides a robust framework for exploring hardware programming with Java on the Raspberry Pi platform. Its simplicity, platform independence, and seamless integration with the Java ecosystem make it an invaluable tool for anyone looking to dive into the world of IoT development.

By leveraging Pi4J’s features and capabilities, developers can unleash their creativity, build interactive prototypes, automate tasks, and bring their IoT ideas to life with ease. With Pi4J, the only limit is your imagination. So, grab your Raspberry Pi, fire up Pi4J, and embark on your journey to explore the exciting possibilities of IoT development with Java!
